### Keyboard Inputs
Keyboard input and mouse input are handled in the [Panel] class.

They get to the [Player] class through [keyPress(int)] and [keyRelease(int)], and then handled in the [handleInputs()] function wich gets called in the [actionPerformed(ActionEvent)] in the [Panel] class.

The [update(double, int)] function of the [PhysicsBall] class was overriden in the [Player] class. it will handle physics updates and timer updates by the [updateTimers(double)] function. 

If the player is falling or has just jumped, the [boolean airBorne] attribute will be set to true. If the collisionListener [LandingListener] is notified of a collision which contact point is below the players hitbox, [boolean airBorne] will be set to false. The player has a coyote time of 0.3s after leaving a surface.

The [draw(Graphics)] function of the [PhysicsBall] class has been overriden by the [Player] class, and will now render a triangle base on the [Vector2 direction] attribute.

[handleInputs()] will resolve any movement of the player, based of attributes [int baseJumpHeight], [int baseSpeed] and [int baseMaxSpeed].



### Mouse Inputs
Added atialiasing to the main [paintComponent] in [Panel] class.

[Player.direction] now follows the mouse cursor through [Mouse Player.mouse.pos], set in the [Panel.mouseMovedOrDragged()].

[Player]'s polygon's points now react to [Player.vel].



### Camera Movement
[Vector2 mapAnchor] of [PhysicsHandler] now responds to [Vector2 mapAnchorVelocity] in [updatePhysics()]. 

[PhysicsHandler] now accepts a [PhysicsObject mainObject], on which position will update [mapAnchorVelocity] when out of [Boundary boundaries]



### Camera Movement 2
[mapAnchor] in now tied to the origin of the objects and affect chunk calculations. [mapAnchor] and objects position have [Vector2 mapAnchorVelocityScaled] added every loop in [updatePhysics()]. 

- public double anchorFollowVelocity = 20;
- public double anchorFollowFriction = 0.97;

[drawRecordedChunks(Graphics g)] function added, it will display yellow borders on chunk that have been loaded to the hash map, and fill active chunks green. 



### Enemy Structure

Separated [class Controller] from [Player], the class contains all the keys and mouse info and methods to update them. 

[Player] and [Controller] moved to [/player] directory.

[/enemies] directory contains all enemy code.

[abstract class Enemy] attributes

- public static PhysicsHandler handler;
- public int health;
- public int damage;
- public Vector2 target = new Vector2();
- public Player player;

Methods

- public void pathToPlayer()
- public void jumpTowardsTarget()
- public void damage(int damage)
- public void kill() // rewards and remove()
- public void remove() // remove from Enemy list and handler objects

[class Normie extends Enemy] added.


### First Enemy AI

Implemented new attributes for [abstract class Enemy]

- public boolean airborne;
- public double jumpCooldown;
- public double jumpTimer;
- public int maxJumpStrenght;
- public int jumpAngleDegrees;
- public double jumpAngleRadians;

Implemented new method [public void setAngle(int angleDegrees)] as a constructor helper

[void updateTimers(double dt)] now updates the enemy [jumpTimer], decreasing it to 0 while not being [airBorne]. Called in [void update(double dt)].

Inside [update(double dt)], if [jumpTimer] reaches 0, the enemy will run [jumpTowardsTarget(pathToPlayer())] and set [jumpTimer] to [jumpCooldown].

[public double pathToPlayer()] will return the angle towards the player, based on [jumpAngleRadians], and set [Vector2 target] to the players position. 

[public void jumpTowardsTarget] will run the parabolic throw formula: 

- if (difference != 0 && cos != 0) {
            jumpVelocity = Math.sqrt(Math.abs((handler.gravity * dx * dx) / (2 * cos * cos * difference)));
        }

If the condition doesn't meet, the jumpVelocity will be set to [maxJumpStrength], which will also cap it. 

[jumpTowardsTarget()] sets [airBorne] to true, which will be set to false once the [class LandingListener extends CollisionListener] gets triggered. 

Added a few enemy types as examples:

- Normie: red, 10 health,  20 radius, 45º jump, 500 max jump, 2s jump cd
- Speedster: green, 10 health,  15 radius, 30º jump, 1000 max jump, 0.5s jump cd
- Jumper: blue, 10 health,  25 radius, 70º jump, 1500 max jump, 2.5s jump cd

[class Panel] now allows to accelerate [class PhysicsHandler] [anchorVelocity] inside [class MyKeyAdapter]. 



### Enemies VFX

[class Enemy] will now only decrease [jumpTimer] if not airborne.

[class Enemy] now overrides [class PhysicsBall][draw(Graphics g)] giving enemies a "bouncy" look, modifyign the oval's height based on [vel.y]

### Renderer Overhaul

Deleted [class Panel extends JPanel] and implemented [class GameCanvas extends Canvas] as the main renderer. 

[setUpGame()] sets up the game ( test for now ) 
[run()] is the main loop. Inside it Delta Time is calculated along with fps that will now display in the windows title, how cool is that?
[run()] calls:
[update(float dt)] runs the physics and player inputs.
[render()] draws the game using a buffer strategy ( BufferStrategy bs = getBufferStrategy(); ), wrapping everything in do whiles to avoid black frames

### Physics update
Updated physics, eliminating the parameter [airBorne] from all entities and replacing with [supported], inherited from physics objects.

### Particles update

Implemented particles, particle pooling, rendering and updating.
[ParticleUpdater] thread starts in [GameCanvas]'s [addNotify()] and [ParticleHandler.render(Graphics2D g)] runs in [GameCanvas.render()]. 

Implemented particles for player landing, jumping and sprinting using [SimpleParticle]s.

All particle concrete classes shall be inside [/particles/types].

### Combat implementation infrastructure

Added [HealthManager] to control the players health.

    Methods:
        > void updateTimers(double dt) // updates the invulnerability cd
        >  void damage(int ammount) // deals damage and sets invulnerable
        > void setInvulnerability() // sets invulnerability timer to de default value
        > void setInvulnerability(double time) // sets invulnerability for the input ammount
        > double getPercent() // returns the percentage of health from maxHealth
        > void regenerateHealth(int ammount) // adds ammount to health


Added to [BatchRenderer].
    
    Methods:
        > void drawRect(Vector2 pos, double w, double h)
        > void drawSquare(Vector2 pos, double w)
        > void drawTriangle(Vector2 a, Vector2 b, Vector2 c)
        > void drawPolygon(Vector2[] verts, int count)

These methods allow for batch rendering of different shapes particles.
Added [TriangleParticle], a spinning fading out triangle.
Added [PhysicsParticle], a SimpleParticle that reacts to gravity.

Added to [Vector2].

    Methods:
       > static Vector2 random(int xMin, int xMax, int yMin, int yMax)
       > static Vector2 random(double xMin, double xMax, double yMin, double yMax) 
       > static Vector2 random(Vector2 corner1, Vector2 corner2)
       > static Vector2 random(int[] xBounds, int[] yBounds)

Returns a random vector within bounds

### Background particles and player damage

Fixed a nullPointerError in [ParticleUpdater] and [ParticleHandler.render()]

Fixed an error in [HealthManager] allowing damage if not vulnerable.

Enemies now damage the player. Damage will emit [TriangleParticle] and player renders with [Player.color.darker()] when not vulnerable.

Implemented the [public boolean background] param for particles, set to false by default.

Implemented [renderBgParticles()] and [renderFgParticles()] in [ParticleHandler].

Added [SimpleBackgroundParticle] to particle types

### Skills implementation

Implemented [SkillsManager] for player's skill handling.

    Atributes:
        > private ArrayList<Skill> skills = new ArrayList<>()
        > public Skill selectedSkill
        > private Player player

    Methods:
        > public void updateTimers(double dt) // update timers for all skills
        > public void updateSkills(double dt) // updates skills
        > public void handleInputs(Controller c) // updates activation through inputs
        > public void addSkill(Skill s)
        > public void removeSkill(Skill s)

Implemented abstratc class [Skill].

    Atributes:
        
        > protected double coolDownTime
        > protected double coolDown
        > protected boolean active
        > protected boolean ready

    Methods: 
    
        > public abstract void updateTimer(double dt)
        > public abstract void update(double dt, Player player)
        > public abstract void handleInputs(Controller c)

Implemented concrete Skill classes [Sprint] (replacing sprint mechanic inside Player.handleInputs()) and [DoubleJump].


### Physics update 2

Updated /physics, adding a physics update thread, unified Batch Rendering and simplified Display actions.
